## Introduction
Faster Projected GAN is a few shot image generation Deep learning model. With data over 100 it's can product fastly better images. For example, gif above represent generated images using AnimalFace-cat (containing 160 cat face images) provided by the authors of FastGAN that you can obtained [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aAJCZbXNHyraJ6Mi13dSbe7pTyfPXha0/view).

## Installation
Clone repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/diarimandimby/Faster-Projected-GAN/
cd Faster-Projected-GAN
```

## Using Faster PG in your own project
```
from discriminator import ProjectedGANDiscriminator
D = ProjectedGANDiscriminator()
```

```
from generator import FasterProjectedGANGenerator
G = FasterProjectedGANGenerator()
```
